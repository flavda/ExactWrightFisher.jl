Exact simulation of the Wright--Fisher diffusion


Implementation of the exact simulation scheme of Jenkins, P. A., Spano, D., & Others. (2017). Exact simulation of the Wright--Fisher diffusion. The Annals of Applied Probability, 27(3), 1478â€“1509.

We consider a continuous time version of the multi-dimensional [Wright-Fisher model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift), which is a stochastic differential equation.

The 1-dimensional version of the Wright-Fisher model is defined by the following equation:
